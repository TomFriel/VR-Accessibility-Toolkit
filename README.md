# VR-Accessibility-Toolkit
A virtual reality accessibility toolkit that both simulates colour blindness

A virtual reality accessibility toolkit that both simulates Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, and provides practical, in-scene guidance to improve colour choices in interactive 3D environments. Rather than serving as visual curiosity, the toolkit is intended to support designers and developers by enabling them to experience issues in context, receive clear feedback on problematic colour combinations that could be difficult for CVD users to interpret.
